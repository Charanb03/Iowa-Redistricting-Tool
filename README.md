# Iowa-Redistricting-Tool  
A legal and data-driven optimization tool designed to support fair district boundary creation in Iowa. Built using Operations Research and Python, this project enhances political representation while ensuring legal compliance and demographic balance.

# 🗺️ Redistricting for Fair Representation  
### 🧮 Applying Optimization to Democracy

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In a democracy like the United States, fair representation is essential—but with over 332 million people across varied regions, drawing political districts fairly is complex. This project focuses on Iowa and introduces a redistricting tool that ensures districts are created in compliance with legal standards and democratic fairness.
